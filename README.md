# Telecomunication analysis

## Bussines understanding
The telecommunication market is growing rapidly, but with this expansion comes increased competition. Telecom companies are facing significant challenges due to revenue loss as customers leave for better offers and services from competing companies. This phenomenon, known as "churn," is becoming a critical issue for businesses, and they are now focusing on understanding customer behavior to address the root causes of churn.

## Objective
1.How to reduce churn and increase retention by predicting high-risk customers and what makes them churn?

2.How can i optimize model performance with the right balance between precision and recall?

3.Building models that Minimize false positives.

4.How class imbalance can be handled to ensure accurate predictions for churners?

5.Develop targeted campaigns based on the model's predictions.

## Data used 
The data used is from  SyriaTel Customer Churn.

## Key resource
pandas, numpy,seaborn,matplotlib.pyplot,warnings,sklearn,sklearn.pipeline,sklearn.model_selection,sklearn.linear_model,sklearn.metrics,sklearn.svm,sklearn.neighbors,sklearn.ensemble,catboost,

## Models
The models used are: Logistic regression,SVM model,KNN model,Random forest and CatBoost.


## The graph shows the churn distribution by state in terms of percentage.
